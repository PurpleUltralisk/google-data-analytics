# Learn about databases

## Metadata
Provide additional information about a file. 
Descriptive metadata - describe a piece of data, and used to identify it at a later time
Structural metadata - indicate how a piece of data is organized, whether it's part of one or more data collection
Administrative metadata - indicate technical source of a digital data. Ie. photos tell where it was taken
