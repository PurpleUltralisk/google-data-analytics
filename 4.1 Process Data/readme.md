# Process Data 

## Data Integrity
The accuracy, completeness, consistency, and trustworthiness of data throughout its lifecycle. 

## Insufficient Data
### No Data
Possible solutions: 
Gather the data on a small scale to perform a preliminary analysis and then request additional time to complete the analysis after you have collected more data. 
If there isn’t time to collect data, perform the analysis using proxy data from other datasets. This is the most common workaround.

### Too Little Data
Possible solutions: 
Do the analysis using proxy data along with actual data.
Adjust your analysis to align with the data you already have.

### Wrong Data
If you have the wrong data because requirements were misunderstood, communicate the requirements again.
Identify errors in the data and, if possible, correct them at the source by looking for a pattern in the errors.

## Calculating Sample Size
*population* - The entire group that you are interested in for your study. 
*sample* - A subset of the population
*margin of error* - Since a sample is used to represent a population, the sample’s results are expected to differ from what the result would have been if you had surveyed the entire population. This difference is called the margin of error. The smaller the margin of error, the closer the results of the sample are to what the result would have been if you had surveyed the entire population. 
*confidence level* - How confident you are in the survey results. For example, a 95% confidence level means that if you were to run the same survey 100 times, you would get similar results 95 of those 100 times. Confidence level is targeted before you start your study because it will affect how big your margin of error is at the end of your study. 
*confidence interval* - The range of possible values that the population’s result would be at the confidence level of the study. This range is the sample result +/- the margin of error.
*statisitical significance* - The determination of whether your result could be due to random chance or not. The greater the significance, the less due to chance.

## Margin of Error 
*Margin of error* is the maximum amount that the sample results are expected to differ from those of the actual population. 
More technically, the margin of error defines a range of values below and above the average result for the sample. The average result for the entire population is expected to be within that range. 
Actual result +/- margin of error = your result range 

## Dirty data 
- Duplicate
- Outdated
- Incomplete - data missing important fields
- Incorrect/inaccurate
- Inconsistent
