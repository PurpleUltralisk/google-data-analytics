# Make Data Drive Decisions

## Six Problem Types

Data analysts usually work with 6 problem types

1. Make predictions
2. Categorize things - assigning items to categories
3. Spotting something unusual
4. Identify themes - group categories into themes
5. Discover connections
6. Finding patterns

## Effective Questions

Effective questions are SMART
S - Specific
M - Measurable
A - Action-oriented
R - Relevant
T - Time bound

Questions should be open-ended

Avoid:

1. Leading questions that only have a particular response
2. Close-ended questions that asks for one-word response
3. Vague questions to don't provide enough context
