# Data Visualization

## Effective Data Visualizations

Four elements of good data visualization:

1. Information - data that you are working with
2. Story - clear compelling narrative
3. Goal - specific object or function of the visual
4. Visual form - effective use of metaphor or visual expression

We can ask ourselves:

1. What is the practical question?
2. What does the data say?
3. What does the visual say?

_Pre-attentive attributes_ - elements of a data visulaization that people recognize automatically without conscious effort.
_Marks_ - visual objects like points, lines, and shapes. Has below 4 qualities:

1. Position - where mark is located in relation to a scale
2. Size - how big the mark is
3. Shape - maybe a human icon to indicate # of people
4. Color  
   _Channels_ - are visual aspects that represent characteristics of the data. Basically marks that have been used to visualize data.
   Three elements to evaluate channel effectiveness:
5. Accuracy - provide proximity estimates
6. Popout - how easy it is to distinguish between values
7. Grouping - how good is a channel at coommunicating groups that exists in the data

## Correlation and Causation

_Correlation_ - is the measure of degree two variables move in relationship to each other.
_Causation_ - an event leads to a specific outcome

Correlation is not causation.

## 9 Principles of Design

1. Balance - visula elements such as color and shape are distributed evenly. Should not hav eone side distract from the other. Ex. similar spacing, and object size.
2. Emphasis - data visualization should have a focal point. So that users can quickly grasp the key idea being presented.
3. Movement - refers to the path viewer's eyes travels.
4. Pattern - use similar shapes and colors
5. Repetition - similar to pattern
6. Proportion - similar to balance
7. Rhythm - similar to movement
8. Variety
9. Unity - visuals should be well organized
