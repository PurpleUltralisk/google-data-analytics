# Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate

Here are the notes that I took while learning the course.
It is a very good introductory to intermediate course on data analytics.

I think many will benefit from some of the tools that this course teaches:

-   Excel
-   SQL
-   R
-   Tableau
-   R Studio
-   Kaggle

Unfortunately this course doesn't go into Python, but the packages in R and workflow is very similar to the pandas package in Python.
